This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
female <- read.csv("female.csv")
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}

```{r}

Merging the dataset.
```{r}
male <- read.csv(file = "male.csv")
male <- male %>%
  filter(Country.Name == "Brazil" | Country.Name == "India" | Country.Name == "United States")

male <- male[ -c(1,2,4,5:8,10:11,13:15)] %>%
  rename("2014" = 2, "2017" = 3, "2021" = 4)

transpose_m <- data.frame(t(male[-1]))
colnames(transpose_m) <- male[, 1]

transpose_m$Brazil = as.numeric(as.character(transpose_m$Brazil))
transpose_m$India = as.numeric(as.character(transpose_m$India))
transpose_m$"United States" = as.numeric(as.character((transpose_m$"United States")))


head(transpose_m)
```

```{r}
transpose_m <- rename(transpose_m, "Brazil_m" = 1, "India_m" = 2, "United_States_m" = 3)


head(transpose_m)
```

```{r}
transpose_m <- rownames_to_column(transpose_m, var="Year")
transpose_f <- rownames_to_column(transpose_f, var="Year")
```

```{r}
acct_owner_by_gender <- merge(x = transpose_m, y = transpose_f, by = "Year", all.x = TRUE)
acct_owner_by_gender <- rename(acct_owner_by_gender, "United_States" = 7)

head(acct_owner_by_gender)
```
```{r}
gfg_plot <- ggplot(acct_owner_by_gender, aes(x=year)) +
geom_line(aes(y = India), color = "black") +
geom_line(aes(y = India_m), color = "red") +
geom_line(aes(y = Brazil), color = "green") +
geom_line(aes(y = Brazil_m), color = "blue") +
geom_line(aes(y = United_States), color = "purple") +
geom_line(aes(y = United_States_m), color = "violet")

gfg_plot
```
 **Project 1**
i) (Cleaning up the final plot) The final plot is somewhat misleading: the y-axis is titled “India”. Write
down the code that will change it to percentage ownership
 
```{r}
gfg_plot <- ggplot(acct_owner_by_gender, aes(x=year)) +
geom_line(aes(y = India), color = "black") +
geom_line(aes(y = India_m), color = "red") +
geom_line(aes(y = Brazil), color = "green") +
geom_line(aes(y = Brazil_m), color = "blue") +
geom_line(aes(y = United_States), color = "purple") +
geom_line(aes(y = United_States_m), color = "violet") +
ylab("percentage ownership")
gfg_plot
```
 ii). (Drawing Conclusions) After drawing the plot that includes how percentages change over time,
use this to draw some conclusions on the how the ownership percentages have been changed. For
example, you can discuss whether males have more account ownership than females and whether
the data suggests that account ownership percentages are on the rise

```{r}
